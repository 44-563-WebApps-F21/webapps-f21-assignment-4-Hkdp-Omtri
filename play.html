    <h2> An Ideal Husband </h2>
    <h3> ACT IV. _Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House_. </h3>
    <p class="stage-direction">
        [goring _is standing by the fireplace with his hands in his pockets_. _He is looking rather bored_.]</p>
    <h6 class="name goring fas fa-user h6">LORD GORING</h6>
    <p class="speech">Good heavens! No. What does it say? </p>
    <h6 class="name caversham fas fa-user h5">LORD CAVERSHAM</h6>
    <p class="speech">What should it say, sir? Everything complimentary, of
        course. Chiltern’s speech last night on this Argentine Canal scheme was
        one of the finest pieces of oratory ever delivered in the House since
        Canning.</p>
    <h6 class="name goring fas fa-user h6">LORD GORING</h6>
    <p class="speech">Ah! Never heard of Canning. Never wanted to. And did . . .
        did Chiltern uphold the scheme?</p>
    <h6 class="name caversham fas fa-user h5">LORD CAVERSHAM</h6>
    <p class="speech">Uphold it, sir? How little you know him! Why, he
        denounced it roundly, and the whole system of modern political finance.
        This speech is the turning-point in his career, as _The Times_ points
        out. You should read this article, sir.
    <p class="stage-direction">[_Opens_ The Times.] </p>
    <p class="speech"> ‘Sir
        Robert Chiltern . . . most rising of our young statesmen . . . Brilliant
        Orator . . . Unblemished career . . . Well-known integrity of character
        . . . Represents what is best in English public life . . . Noble contrast
        to the lax morality so common among foreign politicians.’ They will
        never say that of you, sir.</p>
    <h6 class="name goring fas fa-user h6">LORD GORING</h6>
    <p class="speech">I sincerely hope not, father. However, I am delighted at
        what you tell me about Robert, thoroughly delighted. It shows he has got
        pluck.</p>
    <h6 class="name caversham fas fa-user h5">LORD CAVERSHAM</h6>
    <p class="speech">He has got more than pluck, sir, he has got genius.</p>
    <h6 class="name goring fas fa-user h6">LORD GORING</h6>
    <p class="speech">Ah! I prefer pluck. It is not so common, nowadays, as
        genius is.</p>
    <h6 class="name caversham fas fa-user h5">LORD CAVERSHAM</h6>
    <p class="speech">I wish you would go into Parliament.</p>
    <h6 class="name goring fas fa-user h6">LORD GORING</h6>
    <p class="speech">My dear father, only people who look dull ever get into the
        House of Commons, and only people who are dull ever succeed there.</p>
    <h6 class="name caversham fas fa-user h5">LORD CAVERSHAM</h6>
    <p class="speech"> Why don’t you try to do something useful in life?</p>
    <h6 class="name goring fas fa-user h6">LORD GORING</h6>
    <p class="speech">I am far too young.</p>
    <h6 class="name caversham fas fa-user h5">LORD CAVERSHAM</h6>
    <p class="stage-direction">[_Testily_.]</p>
    <p class="speech"> I hate this affectation of youth, sir. It
        is a great deal too prevalent nowadays.</p>
    <h6 class="name goring fas fa-user h6">LORD GORING</h6>
    <p class="speech">Youth isn’t an affectation. Youth is an art.</p>
    <h6 class="name caversham fas fa-user h5">LORD CAVERSHAM</h6>
    <p class="speech"> Why don’t you propose to that pretty Miss Chiltern? </p>
    <h6 class="name goring fas fa-user h6">LORD GORING</h6>
    <p class="speech">I am of a very nervous disposition, especially in the
        morning.</p>
    <h6 class="name caversham fas fa-user h5">LORD CAVERSHAM</h6>
    <p class="speech">I don’t suppose there is the smallest chance of her
        accepting you.</p>
    <h6 class="name goring fas fa-user h6">LORD GORING</h6>
    <p class="speech">I don’t know how the betting stands to-day.</p>
    <h6 class="name caversham fas fa-user h5">LORD CAVERSHAM</h6>
    <p class="speech"> If she did accept you she would be the prettiest fool in
        England.</p>
    <h6 class="name goring fas fa-user h6">LORD GORING</h6>
    <p class="speech">That is just what I should like to marry. A thoroughly
        sensible wife would reduce me to a condition of absolute idiocy in less
        than six months.</p>
    <h6 class="name caversham fas fa-user h5">LORD CAVERSHAM</h6>
    <p class="speech"> don’t deserve her, sir.</p>
    <h6 class="name goring fas fa-user h6">LORD GORING</h6>
    <p class="speech">My dear father, if we men married the women we deserved, we
        should have a very bad time of it.</p>
