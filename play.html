<h3> ACT IV. _Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House_. </h3>
<p>
    [LORD GORING _is standing by the fireplace with his hands in his pockets_.  _He is looking rather bored_.]<br>

    LORD GORING.  Good heavens!  No.  What does it say? <br>

    LORD CAVERSHAM.  What should it say, sir?  Everything complimentary, of
    course.  Chiltern’s speech last night on this Argentine Canal scheme was
    one of the finest pieces of oratory ever delivered in the House since
    Canning.<br>
    
    LORD GORING.  Ah!  Never heard of Canning.  Never wanted to.  And did . . .
    did Chiltern uphold the scheme?<br>
    
    LORD CAVERSHAM.  Uphold it, sir?  How little you know him!  Why, he
    denounced it roundly, and the whole system of modern political finance.
    This speech is the turning-point in his career, as _The Times_ points
    out.  You should read this article, sir.  [_Opens_ The Times.]  ‘Sir
    Robert Chiltern . . . most rising of our young statesmen . . . Brilliant
    Orator . . . Unblemished career . . . Well-known integrity of character
    . . . Represents what is best in English public life . . . Noble contrast
    to the lax morality so common among foreign politicians.’  They will
    never say that of you, sir.<br>
    
    LORD GORING.  I sincerely hope not, father.  However, I am delighted at
    what you tell me about Robert, thoroughly delighted.  It shows he has got
    pluck.<br>
    
    LORD CAVERSHAM.  He has got more than pluck, sir, he has got genius.<br>
    
    LORD GORING.  Ah! I prefer pluck.  It is not so common, nowadays, as
    genius is.<br>
    
    LORD CAVERSHAM.  I wish you would go into Parliament.<br>
    
    LORD GORING.  My dear father, only people who look dull ever get into the
    House of Commons, and only people who are dull ever succeed there.<br>
    
    LORD CAVERSHAM.  Why don’t you try to do something useful in life?<br>
    
    LORD GORING.  I am far too young.<br>
    
    LORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Testily_.]  I hate this affectation of youth, sir.  It
    is a great deal too prevalent nowadays.<br>
    
    LORD GORING.  Youth isn’t an affectation.  Youth is an art.<br>
    
    LORD CAVERSHAM.  Why don’t you propose to that pretty Miss Chiltern?<br>
    
    LORD GORING.  I am of a very nervous disposition, especially in the
    morning.<br>
    
    LORD CAVERSHAM.  I don’t suppose there is the smallest chance of her
    accepting you.<br>
    
    LORD GORING.  I don’t know how the betting stands to-day.<br>
    
    LORD CAVERSHAM.  If she did accept you she would be the prettiest fool in
    England.<br>
    
    LORD GORING.  That is just what I should like to marry.  A thoroughly
    sensible wife would reduce me to a condition of absolute idiocy in less
    than six months.<br>
    
    LORD CAVERSHAM.  You don’t deserve her, sir.<br>
    
    LORD GORING.  My dear father, if we men married the women we deserved, we
    should have a very bad time of it.<br>
