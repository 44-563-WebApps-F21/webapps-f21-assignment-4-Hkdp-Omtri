    <h3> ACT IV. _Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House_. </h3>
    <p class="stage-direction">
        [goring _is standing by the fireplace with his hands in his pockets_. _He is looking rather bored_.]</p>
    <h4 class="name goring">LORD GORING</h4>
    <p class="speech">Good heavens! No. What does it say? </p>
    <h4 class="name caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h4>
    <p class="speech">What should it say, sir? Everything complimentary, of
        course. Chiltern’s speech last night on this Argentine Canal scheme was
        one of the finest pieces of oratory ever delivered in the House since
        Canning.</p>
    <h4 class="name goring">LORD GORING</h4>
    <p class="speech">Ah! Never heard of Canning. Never wanted to. And did . . .
        did Chiltern uphold the scheme?</p>
    <h4 class="name caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h4>
    <p class="speech">Uphold it, sir? How little you know him! Why, he
        denounced it roundly, and the whole system of modern political finance.
        This speech is the turning-point in his career, as _The Times_ points
        out. You should read this article, sir.
    <p class="stage-direction">[_Opens_ The Times.] </p>
    <p class="speech"> ‘Sir
        Robert Chiltern . . . most rising of our young statesmen . . . Brilliant
        Orator . . . Unblemished career . . . Well-known integrity of character
        . . . Represents what is best in English public life . . . Noble contrast
        to the lax morality so common among foreign politicians.’ They will
        never say that of you, sir.</p>
